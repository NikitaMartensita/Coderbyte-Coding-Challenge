// Question: Lots of 0’s-How many zeros are on the end of n! ? Assume n is big. So n! is REALLY big.
// Answer: Because one 2 and one 5 can be multiplied to have a zero, and there are more 2’s can be divided by
// a large number n!, thus we only need to count the number of 5 that can be divided by n!. For this problem,
// we can count how many times for 1, 2, 3….n each can divided by 5, and sum the results(the result should discard
// the decimal part before summation) to have the number of trailing zeroes. 

function zerosOfFac(num) {
    var count=0;
    var den=5;
    var value = num/den;
    while(value>=1){
        count+=Math.floor(value);
        den*=5;
        value = num/den;
    }
return count;
}
